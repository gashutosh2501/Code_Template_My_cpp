# 🚀 Competitive Programming Algorithm Templates (2100+ Codeforces Level)

Welcome to my personal Competitive Programming (CP) template library. This repository contains hand-written implementations of **advanced data structures and algorithms** commonly used to solve **2100+ rated problems** on platforms like **Codeforces**, **CSES**, and **AtCoder**.

Whether it's a contest, virtual round, or offline training—this collection is my go-to arsenal for writing efficient and clean solutions under pressure.

## 🧠 What's Inside?

This repository is organized into modular files for each topic. Every implementation is:

- ✅ Clean & readable
- ✅ Optimized for speed
- ✅ Tested on real CP problems

| Category | Algorithms / Templates |
|---------|-------------------------|
| 🔤 Strings | Aho-Corasick, KMP, Z-Algorithm, Manacher’s |
| 🌲 Trees | Binary Lifting, Euler Tour, HLD, Tree DP |
| 🧭 Graphs | Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Kosaraju's SCC |
| 📐 Geometry | Convex Hull, Line Intersection, Polygon Area |
| 📊 Classic | DSU, Sieve, Matrix Chain Multiplication |
| 📦 Others | Suffix Tree, Suffix Automaton, Power Exponentiation |
